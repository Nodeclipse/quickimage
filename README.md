# QuickImage
## Eclipse plugin for browsing images

The QuickImage plugin provides an eclipse-editor for viewing images. You can browse images one by one, or all as thumbnails. 
Use the toolbar to navigate or by single- or double-clicking the images. By default QuickImage associates its editor with .gif .jpg .jpeg .png .bmp .ico
